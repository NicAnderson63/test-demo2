<p> In 2020, someone died from a fatal drug overdose every five hours in New York City. Seventy-seven percent of the fatal overdoses were caused by non-pharmaceutical related. Heroin, cocaine, crack, counterfeit pills, ketamine, methamphetamine or other drugs may contain various traces of fentanyl. The Bronx, Staten Island and Manhattan experienced the highest number of deaths.
</p>

<p> New Yorkers and city officials are working to keep New Yorkers alive by promoting education and expanding access of harm reduction tools.

     <div class="container text"> <h2> ICON 1: What is harm reduction? </h2> Harm reduction saves lives by decreasing the negative side effects of using substances through using various strategies and ideologies. The first step is to accept that illicit and licit drug use is part of society. The National Harm Reduction Coalition said… “ “...

          <p> Never use alone but if you do and you have a phone, call the “Never Use Alone” hotline at 800-484-3731.
          <ul>
            <li> Always be careful when using, go slow.
            <li> Create an overdose plan with people who care about you.
            <li> If or when ready, seek out methadone treatment with a medical provider.
          </ul>

    <div class="container text"><h2> ICON 2: What is the difference between an opioid and an opiate? What is fentanyl? </h2> Opiates are derived from poppy sap and fibers and include opium, morphine, codeine and heroin. Opiods are not derived from plant matter but are made synthetically. <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/adpc/pages/opiate-opioid.aspx" target="_blank" title="Opiods v. Opiates">According to the Oregon Health Department, </a> the list of opioids is long but the "well-known" types include:

              <ul>
            <li> Dextromethorphan (available in the U.S. without prescription as, e.g., NyQuil, Robitussin, TheraFlu, Vicks) </li>
            <li> Dextropropoxyphene (e.g., Darvocet-N, Darvon)</li>
            <li>Loperamide (e.g., Imodium) </li>
            <li> Loperamide (e.g., Imodium)  </li>
            <li> Hydrocodone (e.g., Vicodin) </li>
            <li> Oxycodone (e.g., Oxycontin, Percocet) </li>
            <li> Oxymorphone (e.g., Opana) </li>
            <li> Meperidine (e.g., Demerol) </li>
            <li> Methadone (e.g., Dolophine) </li>
            <li> Fentanyl/fentanil (e.g., Ultiva, Sublimaze, Duragesic patch) </li>
            <li> Carfentanyl/carfentanil (e.g., Wildnil, for veterinary use) </li>
            </ul>

          Opioids are used as pain relievers and produce feelings of happiness and comfort. Side effects include constipation, nausea, drowsiness and respiratory depression. When used as prescribed by a doctor, the risk of overdose is low. Increased risks for an overdose can happen when there is a change in tolerance, mixing drugs, drug quality, previous (non-fatal) overdose and using alone. Even consuming or injecting a “low dose” of fentanyl can cause an overdose as it is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine and 30 to 50 times stronger than heroin.

        <div class= "container text"><h2> ICON 3: What does an overdose look like? </h2> What are the signs of an overdose?
            <ul>
              <li> Stopped or slowed breathing
              <li> Unconscious or unresponsive </li>
              <li> Blue/gray/white lips or nails – sometimes both. </li>
              <li> Snoring or gurgling sounds (when unconscious or unresponsive). </li>
              <li> Muscle stiffness or rigidity (sign of fentanyl). </li>
            </ul>
            If you believe someone is overdosing, try to wake the person up with your words or a sternum rub. If the person is still unresponsive, use Naloxone/Narcan and then call for an ambulance.
